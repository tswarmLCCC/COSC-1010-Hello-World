Welcome to the exciting world of programming! If you're just getting started, there's no better way to embark on your coding journey than by creating your very first program. In this introduction, we'll guide you through the process of writing a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.

Programming is like learning a new language, and Python is an excellent language for beginners due to its readability and simplicity. The "Hello, World!" program is a classic starting point for any programming language. It's a small, yet significant, program that introduces you to the basic structure of code and helps you verify that your development environment is set up correctly.

So, let's dive in and write your first Python program! Get ready to see the timeless message "Hello, World!" printed on your screen, marking the beginning of your programming adventure.

Fork this Replit  to your Replit Account.  Please consult the 'Using Replit' instructions in the assignment if you're unfamiliar with this process.

In this main.py file that was created for you, type this into your new program:
print("hello world!") after this commented section (below the three single quotes at the bottom of the page).

Press the 'Run button' at the top of the screen and observe the text that is created in the Console.
